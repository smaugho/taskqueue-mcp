- **Task `Plan Review #1`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Run the full validation suite by executing the following commands one at a time, ensuring each passes before running the next: `npm test`.
    - Analyse the validation results in conjunction with the specifics of the bug report or modification request.
    - Identify all affected application layers (e.g., domain, application, infrastructure).
    - **Mandatory Pre-Formulation Step: Perform Reference Gathering.** Following the `dev_workflow` procedure for "Reference Gathering for New Tasks", collect all necessary references. This informs the formulation of all proposed new tasks detailed below.
    - Based on the preceding analysis and the gathered references, formulate a comprehensive and detailed plan. This plan must include:
        - Proposals for the `Component Batch #1 – Red` task.
        - Proposals for the `Component Batch #1 – Green` task.
        - Proposals for the `Component Batch #1 – Refactor` task.
        - The **full, detailed analysis and strategic plan itself**, which is intended to be the complete description for the subsequent `Plan Review #2` task.
    - **Present the complete analysis and the comprehensive proposed plan (explicitly stating that this includes the intended description for `Plan Review #2`) to the human developer.**
    - **Await explicit confirmation and approval from the human developer before proceeding to create any tasks.**
    - Upon receiving approval:
        - Create the proposed `Component Batch #1` tasks and the `Plan Review #2` task. When doing so, ensure that the description of each new task adheres to the structure defined in `dev_workflow.mdc`, explicitly including the "Related Tasks" section to link it with other concurrently created tasks (e.g., listing other batch tasks and the next Plan Review task by title and ID). The description for `Plan Review #2` **MUST** be populated with the full, detailed analysis and strategic plan formulated above, and **MUST also carry forward any unresolved items, pending decisions, or deferred topics from this `Plan Review #1`** that were not actioned in the proposed Component Batch #1, unless explicitly removed by the human developer. Use `mcp_taskqueue_add_tasks_to_project` for task creation.
        - Record the human developer's approval and the successful creation of these new tasks in the `completedDetails` for this `Plan Review #1` task.
- **Task `Component Batch #n – Red`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Write a failing unit/integration test that reproduces the bug or specifies the modified behaviour.
    - The primary focus is on crafting the test itself.
    - No functional implementation should be created in this phase, with the potential exception of definitions (e.g., interfaces, types, empty function signatures) absolutely necessary for the test to compile and express the intended behavior. Actual functional implementation is deferred to the Green phase.
    - Tests must follow `testing_strategy.mdc` (including lint checks with 0 errors/0 warnings unless explicitly accepted for warnings).
    - Refer to `code_quality.mdc` for general coding standards.
    - Validate the expected failure.
- **Task `Component Batch #n – Green`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Write the minimal production code strictly to make the failing test from the "Red" phase pass.
    - Focus solely on this minimal implementation; do not add extra features or refactor at this stage.
    - If it is discovered that a test from the "Red" phase needs to be updated or changed, this situation **MUST** be explained to the human developer, and the test **MUST NOT** be updated unless explicit approval to do so is given by the human developer.
    - Refer to `code_quality.mdc` for general coding standards.
    - Validate that all relevant tests now pass.
- **Task `Component Batch #n – Refactor`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Improve the internal structure of the code written in the "Green" phase (and potentially related existing code) without changing its external behaviour. This includes removing duplication, improving clarity, removing unnecessary comments, and adhering to coding standards.
    - Actively look for opportunities to improve other parts of the files that were touched during the "Green" phase, even if these improvements are not directly related to the immediate objective of the current task.
    - Ensure all tests still pass.
    - Refer to `code_quality.mdc` for general coding standards.
    - After validation, follow the **Standard Commit Procedure** (detailed below in this document, ensuring to include `.tasks.json` in the commit). Record the commit hash in `completedDetails`.
- **Task `Plan Review #n (n>1)`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Run the full validation suite by executing the following commands one at a time, ensuring each passes before running the next: `npm test`. Analyse the results to decide whether the goal has been met.
    - If not met or further iterations are needed:
        - **Mandatory Pre-Formulation Step: Perform Reference Gathering.** Following the `dev_workflow` procedure for "Reference Gathering for New Tasks", collect all necessary references. This informs the formulation of all proposed new tasks detailed below.
        - Formulate a detailed plan for the next `Component Batch #n+1 – Red`, `Component Batch #n+1 – Green`, `Component Batch #n+1 – Refactor` tasks, and the subsequent `Plan Review #n+1` task.
    - If the goal is met:
        - **Mandatory Pre-Formulation Step: Perform Reference Gathering.** Following the `dev_workflow` procedure for "Reference Gathering for New Tasks", collect all necessary references. This informs the formulation of the `Review Documentation` task detailed below.
        - Formulate a detailed plan for the `Review Documentation` task.
    - **Present the full analysis and the proposed plan (including the detailed description for the next Plan Review or Review Documentation task) to the human developer. Await explicit confirmation before proceeding.** Upon confirmation, create the proposed tasks using `mcp_taskqueue_add_tasks_to_project`. When doing so, ensure that the description of each new task adheres to the structure defined in `dev_workflow.mdc`, explicitly including the "Related Tasks" section to link it with other concurrently created tasks. The `completedDetails` for this task should note the approval and task creation. The description for the newly created next `Plan Review #n+1` or `Review Documentation` task **MUST** be populated with the full, detailed analysis and plan formulated for the upcoming batch/documentation, and **MUST also carry forward any unresolved items, pending decisions, or deferred topics from the current `Plan Review #n`** that were not actioned, unless explicitly removed by the human developer.
- **Task `Review Documentation`**:
    - **Initial Step:** Upon starting this task, its status **MUST** be updated to `in progress` using `mcp_taskqueue_update_task(projectId, taskId, status='in progress')`.
    - Update docs/rules accordingly, then follow the **Standard Commit Procedure** (detailed below in this document). Record the commit hash in `completedDetails`.

- **Capturing Broader Plan Feedback Mid-Task**:
    - If, while a `Component Batch #n` task (Red, Green, or Refactor) is in progress, the human developer provides input or requests modifications that pertain to the *overall project plan* or scope for *future batches* (rather than the current task):
        - Acknowledge the human developer\'s input.
        - The AI agent should analyze and potentially enrich this input.
        - The AI agent **MUST** then identify the *next sequential, unapproved* task in the current project that is either a `Plan Review #(n+1)` (or similarly named, e.g., `Plan Review #2` if the current batch is `#1`) or the `Review Documentation` task (if this is the final component batch cycle). This involves:
            - Using `mcp_taskqueue_list_tasks` for the current `projectId`.
            - Filtering these tasks to find the relevant future `Plan Review` or `Review Documentation` task by its title and ensuring it is not yet approved.
        - The AI agent **MUST** then update the description of this identified future `Plan Review` or `Review Documentation` task by *appending* the human developer\'s input and any AI-generated enrichment. Care **MUST** be taken to preserve all existing content in that future task\'s description, especially the detailed plan carried over from any preceding Plan Review.
        - The current `Component Batch #n` task should then continue as originally defined, with the developer\\\'s broader plan feedback now safely captured for consideration at the next formal planning stage.

- **Standard Commit Procedure**:
    All commits, whether scheduled within a task (e.g., after a `Refactor` phase or `Review Documentation`) or requested ad-hoc by the human developer, **MUST** follow this procedure:

    1.  **Identify Changes:** Review the files modified in the workspace (e.g., using `git status --porcelain` or IDE indicators) that are ready to be committed.
    2.  **Craft Commit Message:** Prepare a commit message adhering to the Conventional Commits standard (see `commitlint.config.js`, which extends `@commitlint/config-conventional`). The message should accurately describe the work performed. Examples for Bug/Modification:
        *   `fix: correct calculation for scenario Y`
        *   `feat: add new validation rule to Z form`
        *   `refactor(AComponent): simplify logic for B`
        *   `docs: update API spec for C endpoint`
    3.  **Seek Approval & Stage Files:**
        *   Present the list of files to be committed and the proposed commit message to the human developer for approval.
        *   Upon receiving approval, stage **only** the agreed-upon files using the appropriate git command (e.g., `git add <file1> <file2>...` or `git add path/to/specific/file.ts`). This should be a single terminal command. *Avoid using `git add .` unless explicitly approved and all unstaged changes are intended for the commit.*
    4.  **Perform Commit:** Execute the commit with the approved message (e.g., `git commit -m "Your conventional commit message"`). This should be a separate terminal command. Husky pre-commit hooks (linting, tests, etc.) will run automatically.
    5.  **Handle Hook Results & Record Hash:**
        *   **If Husky hooks fail:** The issues reported by Husky (e.g., linting errors, failing tests) **MUST** be corrected. After corrections, return to Step 3 (Seek Approval & Stage Files, as files will have changed) and repeat the commit process for the corrected changes.
        *   **If Husky hooks pass:** Obtain the commit hash (e.g., using `git log -1 --pretty=format:%H`). This hash **MUST** be recorded in the `completedDetails` of the current task when it is marked as 'done'.

    **Condition for Committing in Bug / Use-Case Modification Category:**
    *   **Scheduled Commits (end of `Refactor` or `Review Documentation` tasks):** All validations defined for that task (unit/integration tests, lint, build, E2E tests if applicable) **MUST** pass.
    *   **Ad-hoc Commits (requested by human developer mid-task):** All relevant unit and integration tests for the changes being committed **MUST** be passing. If E2E tests are expected to pass at the current stage of development for the specific changes, they should also be passing. Linting and build checks for the files being committed **MUST** be clean. The human developer provides the final go-ahead and guidance if ambiguity exists.
